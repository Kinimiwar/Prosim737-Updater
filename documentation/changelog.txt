====================================
  ADDED:

    - first version of the python code.
    - added the possibility to download and store an update package.
    - added a function to check if folders entered in GUI exist.
    - added a function to check if Prosim modules are running.
    - added a function to pass credentials if remote computers exist.
    
  FIXED:
    - fixed several bugs during the first code generation.
    - if an old update package is not removed from the temp folder before installing a new update, it can lead to a crash. It has been fixed.
    - if an xml file is opened, the GUI is not cleared as it should be. It has been fixed.
    - if a path in a tab is empty, it shouldn't be added to the list containing all Prosim folders.
    - the temp update package in the temp folder wasn't cleared at the right time.
    - if two folders have the same name, for creating a backup, Prosim737 Updater will add a different number to their name to differentiate them.
    _ fixed a typo in the temp folder name.
    _ if a file has to be copied/pasted in a folder which doesn't exist, Prosim737 Updater will create it.
    
  MODIFIED:
    - the GUI has been modified to take care of different credentials.
    - credentials to connect to remote computers are stored in the xml file.
    - all functions to download, unpack, copy/past, store, backup and restore are now run by a different process to avoid freezing of the GUI.
    - if no path is entered in one or more Prosim Updater section, the corresponding xml section is now empty.
    - Prosim737 Updater will not backup .DEM files in ProsimServer folder (as it's an external and heavy package).
