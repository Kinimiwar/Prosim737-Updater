Release notes:
--------------
FDS hardware native support: We are adding more native support for FDS hardware. In this release, FDS CDU's will no longer require FDS-CDU software.
ProSim CDU will no longer accept input from the FDS-CDU software and will instead communicate directly with the CDU. 
FDS MCP's are also supported natively. To enable FDS native support for MCP's, go to the "Drivers" tab of the ProSim737 system configuration screen, click
"Advanced" next to "FDS Hardware support" and enable support for FDS G3 MCP/EFIS. Do not forget to display the FDS-Glare software.
Other natively supported FDS hardware in this release: Multi COM panel, Generic radio and XPDR

For non motorized throttles, we've added an option to show the current physical position of the throttles on the upper EICAS. This will aid in
positioning the physical throttles correctly prior to disengaging the autothrottle. The option can be enabled in the instructor station, on the
Cockpit Setup menu and you can find it under the Display tab as "Show manual throttle position in EICAS".

We've added support for Active Sky Next. To enable Active Sky Next integration, you will need to make sure that FSUIPC writes its radar data in
a file called 'radar.bin' in the ProSim737.exe folder. This is done by adding the following parameter to the [General] section of fsuipc4.ini:
ASNwxRadarPath=<path of prosim737.exe>\radar.bin

We have added the Integrated Approach Navigation option (IAN), which allows you fly any precision or non precision approach using the same methodology.
The option also enables the Navigation Performance Scales in the PFD, which show you lateral and vertical deviation from the path as well as 
RNP and ANP values (Required and Actual Navigation Performance). The option is not enabled by default and can be found in the
instructor station in the Cockpit Setup menu.


October 6 2014  Release version 1.38

Release notes:
--------------
ProSim737 Display:
We have implemented a major change in ProSim737 Display. We are migrating ProSim737 Display to allow user interaction with onscreen
instruments and for this to work, we need mouse interaction. In previous releases, all mouse interaction was used to move 
screens around in ProSim737 Display. Since 1.38, ProSim737 Display will have two operation modes that differ in the way the mouse is handled:
- Normal operation mode
  This mode is the default operation mode. All mouse interaction controls the onscreen instruments. No resizing or moving of screens is
  possible.
- Setup mode
  This mode uses the mouse for manipulating the screen positions. This is how ProSim737 Display used to work by default. The whole background
  of ProSim737 Display will now be blue when you ae in Setup mode. This allows you to better view the workarea of the ProSim737 Display
  instance in case you have it span multiple area behind your MIP.
Saving of the display configuration is no longer done when exiting ProSim737 Display. Instead, ProSim737 Display will save its configuration
when you move it from setup mode to normal operation mode. When you stay in setup mode, ProSim737 Display will also save the configuration
when exiting the application. 

ProSim737 System:
Scenery extraction now uses the scenery.cfg file. In previous releases, all *.bgl files where scanned that where in any subfolders 
of path that was specified in the database dialog window. In this release, ProSim737 will try to locate the scenery.cfg file and it will
use this file to find any path configured there. This will allow ProSim737 to find files on multiple disks.

Release notes:
--------------
The roll commands of the autopilot system have been improved. The autopilot will use a lower rollrate, which is much
more realistic. The mathematics of the bank calculations have been significantly improved to allow better track to track
intercepts. These changes caused lots of modifications in all areas of the autopilot like intercepts, holdings, etc. More
improvements in the spherical trigonometry math of the FMS allows more reliable LNAV and intersection calculations.

A lot of work has been done on X-Plane integration. We are currently focusing on having correct autopilot operation and
basic functionality. In the current state, regular flight with lnav/vnav/autolands should be working. There are still a lot
of subsystems (weather/repositioning/TCAS) that are not yet working with X-Plane. More focus on X-Plane is planned this year.

======================================

Release notes:
--------------
In this release we are including the first version of our weather system. The weather system
is located in the new instructor station. The weather engine of FSX and Prepar3d are based
on METAR reports and since this is also a widely accepted weather format, ProSim737 will also
be based on these reports. The new ProSim737 weather system allows you to create METAR reports
for global weather or for station based weather. Identically to positions, you can store weather
presets in slots and call them up quickly.

Please note that:
- There are still various bugs in the METAR processing of FSX/prepar3d.
- Not all weather functions may work. We are investigating how to improve this.
- More weather feature will appear in other parts of the IOS.
- METAR weather processing requires simconnect, so it is only available on FSX and prepar3d at the moment.

The core navigation system of ProSim has been updated. The position of the aircraft as determined by the FMS is based on
many sources. Individual sources will now have more accurately modeled individual positions. The radio position for instance
is based upon the DME stations best suited for location fixing. The new POS SHIFT CDU page will show the relative position
if the various sources. From here it is also possible to bias the FMS towards a source. This can be seen by the ND's switching
position and the autopilot flying back towards the LNAV course.

Windshears have been added. They will appear randomly based on the weather settings. In FSX/Prepar3d ProSim is able to introduce
the windshear into the flightmodel. Be sure to stay out of the windshear area.

Release notes:
--------------
This releases focuses on restructuring data to improve the user interface and the folder structure.
First of all, all databaserelated files are now moved to the "Database" folder under the main ProSim737 folder. This is done
automatically when you start this release. The new Database folder stores everything, so you can easily copy it to a remote machine.

Also, we are restructuring the position of elements in the configuration screen.
* Old approach: The configuration screen consists of tabs. One tab for every type of element. All switches are under switches, all
  indicators under indicators.
* New approach: We are still grouping items per item type, but we keep related items together. A rotary encoder may have several switch
  inputs that can be used. These will now appear in the "Encoders" tab next to the encoder. Also, addon sounds have switches for controlling
  the sound. These will now also appear in the Sounds tab.

We are also adding a new way to configure rotary encoders. Rotary encoders need fast hardware access and are often handled internally by IO cards.
For example, bodnar cards offer the option to handle encoders internally and convert them to pulse up/pulse down inputs. ProSim now allows you
to configure these pulse up/pulse down inputs instead of the rotary encoder itself. All additional switches for configuring the encoders are now
in the "Encoders" tab of the configuration screen. Always choose one and only one way to configure your encoder. Either choose direct encoder
support by configuring the encoder, OR use pulse up/pulse down inputs, OR use momentary up/momentary down switches (if applicable)
