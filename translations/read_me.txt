The translation system of Prosim737 Updater is based on a text file for each language. In each file, a single line is used for the translation of an object and each line is composed of an item followed by a "=" and a translation.
An item can be the name of an object to be translated (ex: home_lb_1 is the name of a QLabel), the name of an object which will display translated text (ex: info_bt_1 is the name of a button which once clicked will popup translated text) or a context (ex: Download-canceled is not an object but a context during which the download of something has been canceled by a user).
"=" is mandatory after an item and before the translation.
The translation can be simple text (ex: I am a simple translation), a text with a context (ex: I am a simple translation based on %s) or a list of text for object with multiple status, in that case, all texts have to be separated by a "|" (ex: Save...|Click to save your document).
It is possible to add comments to a language file. Just put ### at the beginning of the line and it will be skipped by Prosim737Updater. Empty lines are also skipped.
All items contained in the english.txt file have to be present in other language files. The disposition of all elements is not important: all elements are loaded into a dictionary by Prosim737 Updater.
